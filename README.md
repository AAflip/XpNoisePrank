This project is a second attempt at creating a windows noise prank after gaining a bit more experience.

To run the prank, download the startProcess.bat file and then run it

To stop the prank, open task manager and find a process called `Windows Command Processor` and end it, or alternatively you can just restart the computer
(A method to kill the process will be made eventually)
